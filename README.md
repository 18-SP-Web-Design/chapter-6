# Web Page Design - Spring 2018

## Chapter 6 - Forms

**Discussion:** In Chapter 6, you will create your own web-based forms and learn how to make them send data (in a simple way).

1. Complete the chapter tutorial on pages 283-314 and put the files in the _chapter_ folder.
1. Complete Lab 3 on page 321. However, use your own titles, labels, menu options, or whatever. In other words, create your own form, using three fieldsets and a variety of different input methods and have it send the form's data to an email address.

When you are finished, push the entire repository back to github.
